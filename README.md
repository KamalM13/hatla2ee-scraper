# Hatla2ee Car Listings Scraper

Welcome to the Hatla2ee Car Listings Scraper repository! This project aims to gather data from the Egyptian website Hatla2ee, focusing on used car listings. By scraping relevant information such as car name, brand, model, price, and more, we create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.
## Introduction

In the realm of automotive commerce, online platforms play a crucial role in connecting buyers with sellers. Hatla2ee, a prominent website in Egypt, serves as a marketplace for buying and selling new and used cars. Our project revolves around utlizing web scraping to collect valuable data from Hatla2ee, facilitating insights into the Egyptian automotive market.
## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to extract essential details from car listings on Hatla2ee and compile them into a structured dataset. This dataset serves as a foundation for various applications, including market analysis, trend identification, and decision-making processes within the automotive industry.
## How it Works

Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, our scraper navigates through the web pages of Hatla2ee, systematically extracting relevant information from each listing. By parsing HTML content, we capture key attributes like car name, brand, model, price, mileage, and more. The extracted data undergoes processing and is eventually stored in a CSV file for further exploration.
